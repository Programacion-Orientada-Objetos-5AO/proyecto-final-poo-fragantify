  # Perfumery Website/Application

  This is a code bundle for Perfumery Website/Application. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/4k2FITTwEMofLzL8M4quvu/Perfumery-Website-Application.

  ## Running the code

  1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies (only React/TSX sources are tracked).
  2. Run `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server. The predev script will generate the minimal `index.html` shell automatically before Vite boots.
  3. Run `npm run build` to produce a production bundle in `src/frontend/build/` (prebuild also generates the HTML shell).
